  @section intro Introduction
  This package contains Root classes used in conversion of calibration
  Root files to TDS objects 

  Typical TKR files, like ToT charge injection calibration, will be composed
  of one tree per tower. The tree will have two branches, one with a single
  TkrTower object, the other with a set of objects, each of which has
  data for a single unilayer.  See, for example, the class TotUnilayer.
